## Test environments
* local OS X install, R version 3.3.2 (2016-10-31)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs. 

There were WARNINGs... mostly relating to masked dependencies.

## Other Notes

* Thank you for your patience as I address issues.  It is becoming clearer to me what problems need to be addressed in advance so subsequent submissions should get better over time.
